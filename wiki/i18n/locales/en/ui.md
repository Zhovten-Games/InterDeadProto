# English UI Strings

Localized copy for UI controls, onboarding, and loader flows. Recent additions include `boot.*` labels used by the animated loader, `note_next` for cycling ghost notes, and reaction prompts (`reaction_add`, `reaction_change`, `reaction_confirm`) consumed by the dialog overlay.[^1]

[^1]: Loader, note toggle, and reaction strings [src/i18n/locales/en/ui.json#L49-L106](../../../../src/i18n/locales/en/ui.json#L49-L106)
