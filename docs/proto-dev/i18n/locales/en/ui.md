# English UI Strings

English UI copy for navigation, AI loader feedback, chat launcher labels, and profile registration flows. It also includes spirit dialog keys (`guide.*`, `guest1.*`), profile import/export prompts, and reaction finale messaging used by the dialog widgets and overlays.[^1]

Ghost switching confirmation strings (`ghost_switch.*`) and AI camera badge/loader text are included so control panels and AI overlays can surface contextual prompts and status updates.[^2]
