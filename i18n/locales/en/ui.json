  "guide.stage1": "My name is NIRO. I am the interface assistant in the NOIR messenger. I am not the contact side and do not \"see\" the node: my task is to guide you through the procedure correctly and safely.\n\nPress POST (✉️) to start the guide.",
  "guide.stage2": "In this version of the app, user responses are generated automatically. The pragmatic reason: the number of failed conversations grew because of protocol misunderstandings and attempts to \"answer freely\" where strict contract compliance (RANGE) is required.\n\nA future version may allow you to answer the node manually. For now, do not interfere with the app.\n\nImportant: any attempts to modify the client (root/jailbreak, patching the build, logic substitution, bypassing limits, interference with routing/checks) result in loss of guarantees and disable the prerequisites for safe operation.\n\nPress POST (✉️) to move on to the format and cycle.",
  "guide.stage3": "Messages outside this chat will, in most cases, appear as emoji protocol forms. Each message is a step contract: what responses are allowed (RANGE), what acknowledgment is considered successful (ACK), and what comes next.\n\nThe cycle in this build looks like:\n1. We start the conversation with the node by pressing POST (✉️).\n2. The node responds (reply activity is recorded).\n3. We request the node's history/memory.\n4. The node responds and formulates the first contract task.\n5. We complete tasks strictly within the contract: most often with an image, without extra text.\n6. The node confirms the step with a reaction (ACK) and issues the next request.\n7. After a series of steps — the finale: a result (for example, a link), then completion.\n\nPress POST (✉️) to learn about camera usage in this build.",
  "guide.stage4": "During the chain the node may ask you to photograph an object/scene within the current RANGE. You need to press Camera (📷) and take a shot strictly of what the contract specifies.\n\nAfter shooting the app runs detection. When detection succeeds, the Start analysis (🔍) button becomes available—press it to process the frame.\n\nNext a result window opens. This window records that the system accepted the artifact and processed it per contract.\n\nTo return to the dialog, press Open messenger (💬) directly in the result window—you will be back in the chat where the cycle continues (ACK/next node request).\n\nIf a request implies shooting but image admissibility is unclear, an optional clarification step is allowed before sending the frame (not for \"bargaining\", but to remove ambiguity). I generate such messages automatically; you only need to press POST (✉️) when it is available.\n\nTypical request example for finding a person (template):\n\nMODE 🎭E\nINTENT ❓\nTARGET 🔎👤\nRANGE 🧊🖼️⛓️🙈\nPOLICY 🧱\nOUTPUT 🖼️\n\nMeaning: the node requires strictly an image, then confirms the step with a reaction (ACK).\n\nNow open Camera (📷) and take the first photo (for example, a photo of a person). After that return to the messenger and press POST (✉️) to continue the guide.",
  "guide.stage5": "Key point: the node can be in any state and \"think\" anything about what is happening — but it will express the thought only in the forms allowed by the protocol.\n\nInterpretation remains your risk: the protocol checks admissibility, not \"truth.\"\n\nExample: interpreting 🍆 as The Tower is formally admissible.\n\nNOIR:NIRO STATUS UNSTABLE\nNIRO:MESSAGE UNTYPE\n\"DO NOT DENY YOURSELF ANYTHING, OPERATOR—\"\nNOIR:HALT. COMMERCIAL FILTER APPLIED. CONTENT ADJUSTED.\nNOIR:NIRO STATUS STABLE\n\nSee case: CASE-01 — MARIA_ARCANA / Blind Spot\nhttps://interdead.phantom-draft.com/blog/maria-arcana-blind-spot/\n\nPress POST (✉️) to move to warnings and completion.",
  "guide.stage6": "Nudes and \"flirting\" with the node should be treated as boundary-risk behavior. This is not regulated by the protocol as a safe practice.\n\nAt the same time, NIRO does not interpret content and does not filter it for you automatically. I fix admissibility and remind about boundaries. If the node drives the contract into intimate demands — the correct response is to stop and perform a sanitary completion without discussion — RESET (♻️).\n\nAlso keep in mind: contact can be terminated by the system itself, when it deems it necessary (risk, escalation, boundary violation, prolonged uncertainty, timeout/flow failure).\n\nIf you consistently and correctly unlock all fragments of node memory, the final result can be a phenomenon like EVP — in other words, \"the node will sing\" (usually delivered as a link/audio artifact).\n\nIf conversation artifacts have value for the community, they can be recorded in our blog under Artifacts:\nhttps://interdead.phantom-draft.com/blog/\n\nNIRO does not interpret. NIRO only fixes admissibility.\nAnd separately: we never publish users' personal data in public materials. If an artifact is considered valuable and there is no explicit operator consent to disclose personal data, the artifact is published only in anonymized form and without private identifiers.\n\nConversation history with nodes is switched via ▲/▼ on the panel.\n\nThank you for using the application.\n\nNOIR:NIRO STATUS COMPLETE",
